Hello guys ! This is a project which i'm learning how to create a Discord-BOT and let it work on ! 🐺

## FIRST STEPS 📝

**Firstly **have look** about the Discord API, so if do you want to create a DCbot you must: ![Create an account or loggin (click here)](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)

**Connect your DC-bot  🔌**

You must fisrtly import the necessary packages. I use a _const_ to import it all <img src="https://www.freeiconspng.com/uploads/pokeball-icon-1.png" width="350"

 To initialize the BOT(client) you almost need to call the **_token_**
 
 **_VERY IMPORTANT_:**⚠️ You must _STORAGE_ your **own token** inside a const that must be ignored on your repository ( for example ignoring it by **.gitignore**)⚠️
 
 **🚫NEVER pass directly your TOKEN!!!🚫**
